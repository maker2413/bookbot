#+TITLE: Book Bot

This is just a simple Python application that creates a RSS feed aggregator aka ~Gator~.

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To run Gator you will need to do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  go run . login <user>

  go run .
#+end_src
